Hi There. This is Bin Wang([CV](/public/pdfs/resume.pdf)).

I am a PhD student at [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/default.do), [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I am advised by Dr. [Fan Zhong](http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/~zf/) and Prof. [Xueying Qin](http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/~qxy/index.htm). Previously I received my bachelor degree of software engineering from [Software College](http://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/default.do), [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in June 2012. 

My research interests are in Computer Vision and Augmented Reality. Most of my recent work focuses on object detection and 6 DOF pose estimation. I am also interested in Deep Learning and Robotics.

I like all the simple and ordinary things. I started recording the beauties in my life by camera from 2015. For sports, I like running, hiking and most kinds of ball sports. I keep running for 2 years.
