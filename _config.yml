  desc: I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University under the supervison of Dr. Fan Zhong and Prof. Xueying Qin. My research interests are mainly in 3D computer vision for augmented reality, including 3D object tracking and 6DoF pose estimation. I am also interested in Robotics and Deep Learning. I enjoy simple and ordinary things, so I am recording my life by photographs. Running is my favorite sport, and I started running at 2015. # Describe yourself.
